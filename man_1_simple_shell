.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
<<<<<<< HEAD The \f[B]sh\f[R] utility shall conform to the Base

======= hsh is a compiled project replicating the bash shell hs.
To use hsh simply type ./hsh into the command line to run in interactive
mode, or in non\-interactive mode the user can type echo
\[lq]command\[rq] | ./hsh It also can be run as ./hsh < script to run in
non\-interactive mode.

.SH Argument List Processing
.PP
All of the single letter options that have a corresponding name can be
used as an argument to the \-o option.
The set \-o name is provided next to the single letter option in the
description below.
Specifying a dash \[lq]\-\[rq] turns the option on, while using a plus
\[lq]+\[rq] disables the option.
The following options can be set from the command line or with the set
builtin (described later).

       \-a allexport     Export all variables assigned to.i
       \-c               Read commands from the command_string operand in\[hy]
                        stead of from the standard input.  Special parame\[hy]
                        ter 0 will be set from the command_name operand
                        and the positional parameters ($1, $2, etc.)  set
                        from the remaining argument operands.

       \-C noclobber     Don\[aq]t overwrite existing files with \[lq]>\[rq].       


       \-e errexit           If not interactive, exit immediately if any
                        untested command fails.  The exit status of a com\[hy]
                        mand is considered to be explicitly tested if the
                        command is used to control an if, elif, while, or
                        until; or if the command is the left hand operand
                        of an \[lq]&&\[rq] or \[lq]||\[rq] operator.

       \-f noglob        Disable pathname expansion.

       \-n noexec        If not interactive, read commands but do not exe\[hy]
                        cute them.  This is useful for checking the syntax
                        of shell scripts.

       \-u nounset       Write a message to standard error when attempting
                        to expand a variable that is not set, and if the
                        shell is not interactive, exit immediately.

       \-v verbose       The shell writes its input to standard error as it
                        is read.  Useful for debugging.

       \-x xtrace        Write each command to standard error (preceded by
                        a \[oq]+ \[cq]) before it is executed.  Useful for debug\[hy]
                        ging.

       \-I ignoreeof     Ignore EOF\[aq]s from input when interactive.

       \-i interactive   Force the shell to behave interactively.

       \-l               Make dash act as if it had been invoked as a login
                        shell.

       \-m monitor       Turn on job control (set automatically when inter\[hy]
                        active).

       \-s stdin         Read commands from standard input (set automati\[hy]
                        cally if no file arguments are present).  This op\[hy]
                        tion has no effect when set after the shell has
                        already started running (i.e. with set).

       \-V vi            Enable the built\-in vi(1) command line editor
                        (disables \-E if it has been set).

       \-E emacs         Enable the built\-in emacs(1) command line editor
                        (disables \-V if it has been set).

       \-b notify        Enable asynchronous notification of background job
                        completion.  (UNIMPLEMENTED for 4.4alpha)

       \-p priv          Do not attempt to reset effective uid if it does
                        not match uid. This is not set by default to help
                        avoid incorrect usage by setuid root programs via
                        system(3) or popen(3).

.SH EXIT STATUS

\f[C]
 Errors that are detected by the shell, such as a syntax error, will cause
 the shell to exit with a non\-zero exit status.  If the shell is not an
 interactive shell, the execution of the shell file will be aborted.  Oth\[hy]
 erwise the shell will return the exit status of the last command exe\[hy]
 cuted, or if the exit builtin is used with a numeric argument, it will
 return the argument.

.SH HISTORY

\f[C]
 **dash** is a POSIX\-compliant implementation of /bin/sh that aims to be as
 small as possible.  **dash** is a direct descendant of the NetBSD version of
 ash (the Almquist SHell), ported to Linux in early 1997.  It was renamed
 to dash in 2002.

\f[C]
 Setuid shell scripts should be avoided at all costs, as they are a sig\[hy]
 nificant security risk.

 PS1, PS2, and PS4 should be subject to parameter expansion before being
